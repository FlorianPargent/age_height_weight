```{r}
#| label: "tbl-2"
#| tbl-cap: Standardized item loadings (correlations with the latent variable) for 6 and 2 response categories 
#| ft.align: left

#| apa-note: CFI = Comparative Fit Index (scaled). RMSEA = Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (scaled). SRMR = Standardized Root Mean Residual. Scaled chi-square, scaled df, and scaled p-value are reported. Correlations with the latent variable higher as the self-reported physical item are printed in bold typeface.

#| tbl-cap: Standardized item loadings on the general latent variable for 6 categories controlling for the self-reported physical item and self-reported sex.
#| ft.align: left
#| disable-apaquarto-processing: false
#| apa-note: Loadings on the latent variable or standardized regression weights of the self-reported physical item and self-reported sex greater than .60 are printed in bold typeface.

```{r}
#| label: "tbl-4"
#| tbl-cap: Latent correlations between the latent variables age, body height and body weight for 6 and 2 categories
#| ft.align: left
#| apa-note: Above the diagonal the correlations between the latent variables are shown and below the diag-onal the correlations between the self-reported physical measures are shown. The latent correla-tions were taken out of latent variable models (6 and response categories) including all self-reported physical items and all latent variables with the allocated items. The models showed the following fit. In the diagonal are the reliability estimates Omega for the scales.
